<h3 class="font-weight-light">Hello, from the <span class="font-weight-bold">{{site.author.name}}</span></h3>

We are here to tell you a bit about Supercomputers and what we do with them.

We are based at &nbsp; <a href="https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk"><img src="../images/epcc-logo-new.jpg" width="15%"></a>, home to a range of HPC services.

Many of us are involved in supporting &nbsp; <a href="https://www.archer2.ac.uk"><img src="../images/archer2_logo_small.png" width="15%"></a>, the UK National Supercomputing Service, as well as some of the other services hosted by EPCC including  the UK Tier2 service, &nbsp; <a href="https://www.cirrus.ac.uk"><img src="../images/cirrus_logo_alpha_50.png" width="10%"></a>, and [Dirac](https://dirac.ac.uk/) service Tursa.
