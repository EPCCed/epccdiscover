Supercomputers allow us to understand things that are too difficult to see or measure in real life.

For example, they may be too big, too small, too dangerous, to quick, too slow, etc.  Many of these things are very important to us. 

For example, supercomputers are used to: 
- provide weather forecasts; 
- to help create new medicines; 
- to reduce pollution from planes, boats and cars;
- to help design new ways of generating environmentally friendly forms of energy.Â
