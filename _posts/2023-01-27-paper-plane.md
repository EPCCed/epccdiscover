You can make our ARCHER2 paper plane.

Print off the [template sheet]({{ base.url }}/docs/paper-plane-discover.pdf), double sided.



Then follow the folding instructions, folding along the numbered lines in order.

Now you can launch your plane on a test flight: hopefully it will glide gracefully across the room, but if instead it crumples catastrophically on the carpet, well, it was just a paper plane!

Imagine the issues testing a new full-size plane, though.  The time required to build it, the expense, and the danger to those involved in testing, is massive.  

Creating a computer simulation also takes time, but, once created, it can be tested without danger, and small changes can easily be made and tested until a promising version can be build, with confidence that it is likely to be successful.

Simulations can also be used in the development and testing of many other huge engineering projects.
